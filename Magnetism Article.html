      <p style="font-size:35px">Magnetism has been one of the most important scientific discoveries.
    Magnetism is the force exerted by magnets whether they either attract 
    or repel each other. It is caused by the motion of electrons. Whilst                every substance has atoms, each atom has electrons, particles that carry electric charges. In most substances, equal numbers of electrons spin in the opposite direction, which cancels the magnetism in that substance. This is why materials such as cloth or paper are not highly magnetic. Unlike cloth and paper, substances such as iron, cobalt, and nickel have their electrons spinning in the same direction, making them highly magnetic, but not to the point where they are magnets. All magnets have two poles, north or south. Opposite poles attract to each, while the same poles repel.

  <h3 style="font-size:47px">Geomagnetic poles, Earth's poles shifting</h3>
  
    <p style="font-size:35px">Regular magnets with north and south poles may sound confounding, but geomagnetic poles are a different conversation. Earth’s magnetic poles often move as the earth rotates. The shifting locations of Earth’s poles are recorded in rocks that form when molten material called magma comes up through Earth’s crust and pours out lava. As the lava cools and becomes solid rock, strong magnetic particles within the rock become magnetized by Earth’s magnetic field. The particles in the rock line up with the force of Earth's magnetic field. With this way, the rocks lock in a record of the position of Earth’s geomagnetic poles within that time.
